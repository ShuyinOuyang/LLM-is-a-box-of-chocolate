{"name": "1032", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The difference between versions is the constraints on $n$ and $a_i$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nFirst, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:\n\nYuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has $x$ candies. There are also $n$ enemies numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$. Enemy $i$ has $a_i$ candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation $P$. A permutation is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $\\{2,3,1,5,4\\}$ is a permutation, but $\\{1,2,2\\}$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $\\{1,3,4\\}$ is also not a permutation (because $n=3$ but there is the number $4$ in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do $n$ duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\n  If Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy $P_i$, she wins the duel and gets $1$ candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing.  The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels. \n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations $P$ exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define $f(x)$ as the number of valid permutations for the integer $x$.\n\nYou are given $n$, $a$ and a prime number $p \\le n$. Let's call a positive integer $x$ good, if the value $f(x)$ is not divisible by $p$. Find all good integers $x$.\n\nYour task is to solve this problem made by Akari.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$, $p$ $(2 \\le p \\le n \\le 10^5)$. It is guaranteed, that the number $p$ is prime (it has exactly two divisors $1$ and $p$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ $(1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print the number of good integers $x$.\n\nIn the second line, output all good integers $x$ in the ascending order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the number of good integers $x$ does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n3 4 5\n\nOutput\n1\n3\n\nInput\n4 3\n2 3 5 6\n\nOutput\n2\n3 4\n\nInput\n4 3\n9 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\nInput\n3 2\n1000000000 1 999999999\n\nOutput\n1\n999999998\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, $p=2$.\n\n  If $x \\le 2$, there are no valid permutations for Yuzu. So $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\le 2$. The number $0$ is divisible by $2$, so all integers $x \\leq 2$ are not good.  If $x = 3$, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is the only valid permutation for Yuzu.

{"name": "1162", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nHasan loves playing games and has recently discovered a game called TopScore. In this soccer-like game there are $p$ players doing penalty shoot-outs. Winner is the one who scores the most. In case of ties, one of the top-scorers will be declared as the winner randomly with equal probability.\n\nThey have just finished the game and now are waiting for the result. But there's a tiny problem! The judges have lost the paper of scores! Fortunately they have calculated sum of the scores before they get lost and also for some of the players they have remembered a lower bound on how much they scored. However, the information about the bounds is private, so Hasan only got to know his bound.\n\nAccording to the available data, he knows that his score is at least $r$ and sum of the scores is $s$.\n\nThus the final state of the game can be represented in form of sequence of $p$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$ ($0 \\le a_i$) \u2014 player's scores. Hasan is player number $1$, so $a_1 \\ge r$. Also $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_p = s$. Two states are considered different if there exists some position $i$ such that the value of $a_i$ differs in these states. \n\nOnce again, Hasan doesn't know the exact scores (he doesn't know his exact score as well). So he considers each of the final states to be equally probable to achieve.\n\nHelp Hasan find the probability of him winning.\n\nIt can be shown that it is in the form of $\\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are non-negative integers and $Q \\ne 0$, $P \\le Q$.

If he scores $4$ goals or more than he scores strictly more than his only opponent. If he scores $3$ then his opponent also scores $3$ and Hasan has a probability of $\\frac 1 2$ to win the game. Thus, overall he has the probability of $\\frac 7 8$ to win.\n\nIn the second example even Hasan's lower bound on goal implies him scoring more than any of his opponents.

The first integer $d_ i$ is the distance of the gas station to the right of the origin (in kilometers). The second integer $c_ i$ is the cost per gallon of gas. It is guaranteed that $1\\leq d_ i\\leq 4\\cdot 10^{10}$, $1\\leq c_ i\\leq 10^9$, and that no two gas stations are located at the same point.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible for Tony to complete his trip without running out of gas, print a single integer $C$, the minimum cost to complete the trip. Otherwise, print \u201ccancel road trip\u201d (without quotes).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 10\n2 100\n1 10\n11 5\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 10\n2 100\n1 10\n13 5\nSample Output 2:\ncancel road trip", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfKfqL308kZZhMk5RAeVaZ6URaC", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935658, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nn, g = map(int, input().split())\nstations = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    d, c = map(int, input().split())\n    stations.append((d, c))\n\nstations.sort()\n\ndp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)\ndp[0] = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    for j in range(i):\n        dist = stations[i-1][0] - (stations[j][0] if j == 0 else stations[j-1][0])\n        fuel_needed = dist\n        if j == 0:\n            fuel_needed = min(fuel_needed, g)\n        else:\n            fuel_needed = min(fuel_needed, g + stations[j-1][0] - stations[j][0])\n        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + fuel_needed * stations[i-1][1])\n\nif dp[n] == float('inf'):\n    print(\"cancel road trip\")\nelse:\n    print(dp[n])\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 442, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 657}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35"}, "response": "```python\nn, g = map(int, input().split())\nstations = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    d, c = map(int, input().split())\n    stations.append((d, c))\n\nstations.sort()\n\ndp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)\ndp[0] = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    for j in range(i):\n        dist = stations[i-1][0] - (stations[j][0] if j == 0 else stations[j-1][0])\n        fuel_needed = dist\n        if j == 0:\n            fuel_needed = min(fuel_needed, g)\n        else:\n            fuel_needed = min(fuel_needed, g + stations[j-1][0] - stations[j][0])\n        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + fuel_needed * stations[i-1][1])\n\nif dp[n] == float('inf'):\n    print(\"cancel road trip\")\nelse:\n    print(dp[n])\n```", "index": 0}

{"name": "2827", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nYou are part of an elite hacking group who has just invented a new type of malware, called the hoppers. Hoppers can operate in any high-security computer networks; however, they can only propagate themselves in a very limited way.\n\nA computer network is a set of hosts $V$ ($|V| = N$) and direct links $E$ ($|E| = M$). Each direct link connects two different hosts, allowing them to communicate in both directions. If a host $u$ is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate itself to all hosts $W$ where $W$ is the set of hosts which are connected to any neighbor of $u$. Formally, $W = \\{ w \\mid \\{ (u,v),(v,w)\\} \\subseteq E \\} $. The newly-infected host $w$ can now proceed to infect other hosts in the same manner.\n\nYou are trying to infect all hosts in a particular high-security network by compromising a single host. Of course, a compromised host will be infected with a hopper. Though it may be an impossible mission, you realize that you can trick the administrator into installing new direct links between hosts by submitting IT requests.\n\nToo many requests may arouse suspicion.

In this network, there is no way to spread the hopper to all hosts by compromising only a single host, e.g., if we compromise host $1$, then only hosts $1$ and $3$ are infected, etc. We need to submit one IT request to connect $(1,3)$ to achieve our goal. By doing so, if we compromise host $1$, all hosts $1$, $2$, and $3$ are infected. $1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2$ (thus, host $2$ is infected). $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3$ (thus, host $3$ is infected).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 10\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 1\n1 3\n2 4\n3 5\n4 1\n5 2\nSample Output 2:\n0", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLlmkmNNf9wtwGqhgkB5mDXxTy", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\n# Read input\nN, M = map(int, input().split())\nadj_list = [[] for _ in range(N)]\nfor _ in range(M):\n    u, v = map(int, input().split())\n    adj_list[u-1].append(v-1)\n    adj_list[v-1].append(u-1)\n\n# Find the minimum number of IT requests needed\nmin_requests = 0\nfor u in range(N):\n    if len(adj_list[u]) == N - 1:\n        min_requests = 1\n        break\n\n# Print the output\nprint(min_requests)\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 699, "completion_tokens": 125, "total_tokens": 824}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35"}, "response": "```python\n# Read input\nN, M = map(int, input().split())\nadj_list = [[] for _ in range(N)]\nfor _ in range(M):\n    u, v = map(int, input().split())\n    adj_list[u-1].append(v-1)\n    adj_list[v-1].append(u-1)\n\n# Find the minimum number of IT requests needed\nmin_requests = 0\nfor u in range(N):\n    if len(adj_list[u]) == N - 1:\n        min_requests = 1\n        break\n\n# Print the output\nprint(min_requests)\n```", "index": 0}

Sergey then forgot numbers $s$ and $l$, but he remembers that the distance from the city $s$ to the nearest fast food restaurant was $a$ km, and the distance from the city he stopped at after traveling the first $l$ km from $s$ to the nearest fast food restaurant was $b$ km.

{"name": "3704", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nBerkomnadzor\u00a0\u2014 Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media\u00a0\u2014 is a Berland federal executive body that protects ordinary residents of Berland from the threats of modern internet.\n\nBerkomnadzor maintains a list of prohibited IPv4 subnets (blacklist) and a list of allowed IPv4 subnets (whitelist). All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Berland must configure the network equipment to block access to all IPv4 addresses matching the blacklist. Also ISPs must provide access (that is, do not block) to all IPv4 addresses matching the whitelist. If an IPv4 address does not match either of those lists, it's up to the ISP to decide whether to block it or not. An IPv4 address matches the blacklist (whitelist) if and only if it matches some subnet from the blacklist (whitelist). An IPv4 address can belong to a whitelist and to a blacklist at the same time, this situation leads to a contradiction (see no solution case in the output description).\n\nAn IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer written in the form $a.b.c.d$, where each of the values $a,b,c,d$ is called an octet and is an integer from $0$ to $255$ written in decimal notation. For example, IPv4 address $192.168.0.1$ can be converted to a 32-bit number using the following expression $192 \\cdot 2^{24} + 168 \\cdot 2^{16} + 0 \\cdot 2^8 + 1 \\cdot 2^0$. First octet $a$ encodes the most significant (leftmost) $8$ bits, the octets $b$ and $c$\u00a0\u2014 the following blocks of $8$ bits (in this order), and the octet $d$ encodes the least significant (rightmost) $8$ bits.\n\nThe IPv4 network in Berland is slightly different from the rest of the world. There are no reserved or internal addresses in Berland and use all $2^{32}$ possible values.\n\nAn IPv4 subnet is represented either as $a.b.c.d$ or as $a.b.c.d/x$ (where $0 \\le x \\le 32$). A subnet $a.b.c.d$ contains a single address $a.b.c.d$. A subnet $a.b.c.d/x$ contains all IPv4 addresses with $x$ leftmost (most significant) bits equal to $x$ leftmost bits of the address $a.b.c.d$. It is required that $32 - x$ rightmost (least significant) bits of subnet $a.b.c.d/x$ are zeroes.\n\nNaturally it happens that all addresses matching subnet $a.b.c.d/x$ form a continuous range. The range starts with address $a.b.c.d$ (its rightmost $32 - x$ bits are zeroes). The range ends with address which $x$ leftmost bits equal to $x$ leftmost bits of address $a.b.c.d$, and its $32 - x$ rightmost bits are all ones. Subnet contains exactly $2^{32-x}$ addresses. Subnet $a.b.c.d/32$ contains exactly one address and can also be represented by just $a.b.c.d$.\n\nFor example subnet $192.168.0.0/24$ contains range of 256 addresses. $192.168.0.0$ is the first address of the range, and $192.168.0.255$ is the last one.\n\nBerkomnadzor's engineers have devised a plan to improve performance of Berland's global network. Instead of maintaining both whitelist and blacklist they want to build only a single optimised blacklist containing minimal number of subnets. The idea is to block all IPv4 addresses matching the optimised blacklist and allow all the rest addresses. Of course, IPv4 addresses from the old blacklist must remain blocked and all IPv4 addresses from the old whitelist must still be allowed. Those IPv4 addresses which matched neither the old blacklist nor the old whitelist may be either blocked or allowed regardless of their accessibility before. \n\nPlease write a program which takes blacklist and whitelist as input and produces optimised blacklist. The optimised blacklist must contain the minimal possible number of subnets and satisfy all IPv4 addresses accessibility requirements mentioned above. \n\nIPv4 subnets in the source lists may intersect arbitrarily. Please output a single number -1 if some IPv4 address matches both source whitelist and blacklist.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 total number of IPv4 subnets in the input.\n\nThe following $n$ lines contain IPv4 subnets. Each line starts with either '-' or '+' sign, which indicates if the subnet belongs to the blacklist or to the whitelist correspondingly. It is followed, without any spaces, by the IPv4 subnet in $a.b.c.d$ or $a.b.c.d/x$ format ($0 \\le x \\le 32$). The blacklist always contains at least one subnet.\n\nAll of the IPv4 subnets given in the input are valid. Integer numbers do not start with extra leading zeroes. The provided IPv4 subnets can intersect arbitrarily.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput -1, if there is an IPv4 address that matches both the whitelist and the blacklist. Otherwise output $t$ \u2014 the length of the optimised blacklist, followed by $t$ subnets, with each subnet on a new line. Subnets may be printed in arbitrary order. All addresses matching the source blacklist must match the optimised blacklist. All addresses matching the source whitelist must not match the optimised blacklist. You can print a subnet $a.b.c.d/32$ in any of two ways: as $a.b.c.d/32$ or as $a.b.c.d$.\n\nIf there is more than one solution, output any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n-149.154.167.99\n\nOutput\n1\n0.0.0.0/0\n\nInput\n4\n-149.154.167.99\n+149.154.167.100/30\n+149.154.167.128/25\n-149.154.167.120/29\n\nOutput\n2\n149.154.167.99\n149.154.167.120/29\n\nInput\n5\n-127.0.0.4/31\n+127.0.0.8\n+127.0.0.0/30\n-195.82.146.208/29\n-127.0.0.6/31\n\nOutput\n2\n195.0.0.0/8\n127.0.0.4/30\n\nInput\n2\n+127.0.0.1/32\n-127.0.0.1\n\nOutput\n-1", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfKPDnisFQtQAzmjYl7EdOYpumw", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935658, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nn = int(input())\nblacklist = []\nwhitelist = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().split()\n    if line[0] == '-':\n        blacklist.append(line[1])\n    else:\n        whitelist.append(line[1])\n\n# Check for intersection between whitelist and blacklist\nfor subnet in whitelist:\n    if subnet in blacklist:\n        print(-1)\n        exit()\n\n# Merge overlapping subnets in blacklist\nblacklist.sort()\noptimized_blacklist = []\nfor subnet in blacklist:\n    if not optimized_blacklist:\n        optimized_blacklist.append(subnet)\n    else:\n        prev_subnet = optimized_blacklist[-1]\n        if prev_subnet.endswith('/32'):\n            optimized_blacklist.append(subnet)\n        else:\n            prev_ip, prev_mask = prev_subnet.split('/')\n            ip, mask = subnet.split('/')\n            if prev_mask == mask and prev_ip in ip:\n                continue\n            else:\n                optimized_blacklist.append(subnet)\n\nprint(len(optimized_blacklist))\nfor subnet in optimized_blacklist:\n    print(subnet)\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1458, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 1675}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4f0b692a78"}, "response": "```python\nn = int(input())\nblacklist = []\nwhitelist = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().split()\n    if line[0] == '-':\n        blacklist.append(line[1])\n    else:\n        whitelist.append(line[1])\n\n# Check for intersection between whitelist and blacklist\nfor subnet in whitelist:\n    if subnet in blacklist:\n        print(-1)\n        exit()\n\n# Merge overlapping subnets in blacklist\nblacklist.sort()\noptimized_blacklist = []\nfor subnet in blacklist:\n    if not optimized_blacklist:\n        optimized_blacklist.append(subnet)\n    else:\n        prev_subnet = optimized_blacklist[-1]\n        if prev_subnet.endswith('/32'):\n            optimized_blacklist.append(subnet)\n        else:\n            prev_ip, prev_mask = prev_subnet.split('/')\n            ip, mask = subnet.split('/')\n            if prev_mask == mask and prev_ip in ip:\n                continue\n            else:\n                optimized_blacklist.append(subnet)\n\nprint(len(optimized_blacklist))\nfor subnet in optimized_blacklist:\n    print(subnet)\n```", "index": 0}

For example, the form of the sentence \u201cthis sentence has thirtyone letters\u201d would be \u201cthis sentence has $ letters\u201d.\n\nThe rules that apply to writing numbers are the following:\n - numbers from 1 to 10 are written \u201cone\u201d, \u201ctwo\u201d, \u201cthree\u201d, \u201cfour\u201d, \u201cfive\u201d, \u201csix\u201d, \u201cseven\u201d, \u201ceight\u201d, \u201cnine\u201d, \u201cten\u201d, respectively\n - numbers from 11 to 19 are written \u201celeven\u201d, \u201ctwelve\u201d, \u201cthirteen\u201d, \u201cfourteen\u201d, \u201cfifteen\u201d, \u201csixteen\u201d, \u201cseventeen\u201d, \u201ceighteen\u201d, \u201cnineteen\u201d\n - the remaining double digit numbers are written in a way that we name the tens\u2019 digit and add to it the name of the one digit remaining when we remove the tens\u2019 digit. Specially, if by removing the tens\u2019 digit we remain with zero, we add nothing to it\n - the tens\u2019 digits (respectively from 2 to 9) are named the following: \u201ctwenty\u201d, \u201cthirty\u201d, \u201cforty\u201d, \u201cfifty\u201d, \u201csixty\u201d, \u201cseventy\u201d, \u201ceighty\u201d, \u201cninety\u201d\n - three digit numbers are written in a way that we name the hundreds\u2019 digit number and add to it the number of the double digit number remaining. Specially, if by removing the hundreds\u2019 digit we remain with zero, we add nothing to it\n - the hundreds\u2019 digits (respectively from 1 to 9) are named the following: \u201conehundred\u201d, \u201ctwohundred\u201d, \u201cthreehundred\u201d, \u201cfourhundred\u201d, \u201cfivehundred\u201d, \u201csixhundred\u201d, \u201csevenhundred\u201d, \u201ceighthundred\u201d, \u201cninehundred\u201d\n - the rules that apply for numbers with more than three digits are not relevant because the input data will always be such that the output is less than a thousand\n\nExamples of naming some numbers:\n - 68 = \u201csixty\u201d + \u201ceight\u201d = \u201csixtyeight\u201d\n - 319 = \u201cthreehundred\u201d + \u201cnineteen\u201d = \u201cthreehundrednineteen\u201d\n - 530 = \u201cfivehundred\u201d + \u201cthirty\u201d = \u201cfivehundredthirty\u201d\n - 971 = \u201cninehundred\u201d + \u201cseventy\u201d + \u201cone\u201d = \u201cninehundredseventyone\u201d\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 20$), the number of words in the sentence.

{"name": "3662", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\n\u201cPhew, that was the last one!\u201d exclaimed the garden helper Tim as he threw the last tree plant to the ground. His employer, countess Esmeralda Hunt who owned the estate, has ordered him to arrange an avenue of aspen trees along both sides of the front road leading up to the house. The first trees in the avenue are supposed to be planted at the very beginning of the road, and the last trees of the avenue at the very end of the road. Tim, who was constantly being reminded of her sense of accuracy, knew that the countess would insist on the trees being placed in perfectly aligned tree pairs, one on each side of the road, and with exactly the same spacing between the pairs along the road. However, when bringing the tree plants to the estate, Tim had just dropped them arbitrarily along the left side of the road and was now facing the task of moving the trees to their correct positions to meet the countess\u2019s requirements. Being stronger in mind than in arms, and since it was time for a coffee break anyway before he started digging, he sat down to figure out which trees to move to which positions so as to minimize the total (Euclidean) distance that he had to move the trees. \n\n-----Input-----\nThe input file starts with a positive even integer $N$ between $4$ and $2000$ (inclusive), giving the total number of trees in the avenue.

Remove two cards with a number 3. The remaining sum would be 7 + 7 + 20 = 34. \n\nYou are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is 26.\n\nIn the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28.\n\nIn the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards.

{"name": "3497", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nYou have all heard of the story of the three little pigs. However, this time they\u2019re facing another predicament yet again!\n\nThe three pigs brought a bunch of their pig friends into a tree, which is a connected undirected graph with $V$ vertices and $V-1$ edges. Originally there were $V$ pigs, one on each vertex of the tree. However, $V-P$ big bad wolves suddenly teleported into $V-P$ distinct vertices of $T$ and ate the pigs originally on these vertices. Now there are only $P$ pigs left, and every vertex of $T$ is occupied by a single pig or a single wolf (but not both).\n\nOf course, the surviving pigs now wants to escape. A pig is considered to have escaped if he is on any leaf vertex (a vertex connected to only one edge). A pig currently on vertex $u$ can move to vertex $v$ only if there is an edge connecting $u$ to $v$ and $v$ isn\u2019t occupied by a wolf. However, more than one pig may be on the same vertex at the same time. The pigs want you to help them compute the minimum number of wolves which must be removed such that every pig can escape.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $V$ and $P$, $3\\leq P\\leq V\\leq 200000$. This is followed by $V-1$ lines, each containing two integers $u$ and $v$, where $0\\leq u,v\\leq V-1$, indicating that there is an edge between vertex $u$ and vertex $v$. It is guaranteed that the graph represented by the input is a tree.\n\nThe last line of the input contains $P$ integers, where $p_ i$ ($0\\leq p_ i\\leq V-1$) denotes the initial vertex occupied by the $i^\\mathrm {th}$ pig.

At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:\n\n  if s_{i} = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if s_{i} is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit s_{i} on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.

{"name": "3044", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nYour friend just bought a new programmable robot and has asked for your help. The robot operates in a 2D grid that may contain obstacles. The environment has a known start location and a known goal location. The robot is controlled with a string consisting of commands L, R, U, and D, which respectively instruct the robot to move one square to the left, right, up or down in the grid. The robot will ignore a command (but continue with future commands) if the command would cause it to leave the grid or to run into an obstacle. If the robot were to reach the goal position, it immediately stops its program with success (even if further commands exist).\n\nYour friend has already programmed the robot with a command string, but the problem is that your friend is not a very good programmer, and so it may be that the commands do not lead the robot successfully to the goal. You would like to fix the string so that the robot will reach the goal, but you do not want your friend to feel bad, so you are hoping to make as few changes to the program as are needed. A single change consists either of deleting an arbitrary character of the command string, or inserting an arbitrary command anywhere within the string.\n\nAs an example, if we consider Sample Input\u00a01, we see that your friend\u2019s command string of DRRDD does not succeed. The initial D moves the robot one spot down. From there, the R (and the subsequent R) are ignored because of the obstacle to the robot\u2019s right. The subsequent D moves the robot down once again and the final D is ignored. However, by deleting the initial D, we can rely on the command string RRDD which does successfully lead the robot to the goal.\n\nIf we consider Sample Input\u00a02, we find that your friend\u2019s original command string LDLDLLDR is flawed. However, if we insert the single command U after the fifth command, the resulting string LDLDLULDR successfully guides the robot to the goal. It starts by moving left-down-left; the next down command is ignored because the robot is not allowed to leave the grid. The subsequent left-up-left completes the path to the goal (and the final DR commands are ignored as the robot stops immediately upon reaching the goal).\n\nWith Sample Input\u00a03, your friend\u2019s command string can be corrected with two changes, for example with the new command ULDLDLLDLR (although this is not the only way to use two changes to produce a valid sequence).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains the two integers $H$ and $W$ that respectively define the height and width of the grid such that $1 \\le H, W \\le 50$. The next $H$ lines each has $W$ characters, describing the corresponding row of the grid, such that the character \u2019S\u2019 designates the starting location, \u2019G\u2019 designates the goal location, \u2019#\u2019 designates an obstacle, and \u2019.\u2019 designates an empty location. There will always be precisely one \u2019S\u2019 and one \u2019G\u2019 in the grid, and there will always exist an unobstructed path from the start position to the goal position. The final line of the input contains your friend\u2019s original command string consisting of between $1$ and $50$ characters, inclusive.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer indicating the minimum number of changes that are needed to fix the program.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\nS..\n.#.\n..G\nDRRDD\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 7\n.......\n.G.#.S.\n.......\nLDLDLLDR\nSample Output 2:\n1\n\nSample Input 3:\n3 7\n.#.....\n.G.##S.\n.......\nLDLDLLDR\nSample Output 3:\n2", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLEuzAP9niJdwXmmPexQmQy3tj", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\ndef fix_robot_command(grid, command):\n    def is_valid_move(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] != '#'\n\n    def execute_command(cmd):\n        nonlocal x, y\n        if cmd == 'L':\n            if is_valid_move(x, y - 1):\n                y -= 1\n        elif cmd == 'R':\n            if is_valid_move(x, y + 1):\n                y += 1\n        elif cmd == 'U':\n            if is_valid_move(x - 1, y):\n                x -= 1\n        elif cmd == 'D':\n            if is_valid_move(x + 1, y):\n                x += 1\n\n    changes = 0\n    for i in range(len(command)):\n        x, y = start_x, start_y\n        for j in range(len(command)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            execute_command(command[j])\n        if x == goal_x and y == goal_y:\n            return changes\n        changes += 1\n\n    return changes\n\n# Input\nH, W = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input() for _ in range(H)]\ncommand = input().strip()\n\n# Find start and goal positions\nfor i in range(H):\n    for j in range(W):\n        if grid[i][j] == 'S':\n            start_x, start_y = i, j\n        elif grid[i][j] == 'G':\n            goal_x, goal_y = i, j\n\n# Output\nprint(fix_robot_command(grid, command))\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 803, "completion_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 1148}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4f0b692a78"}, "response": "```python\ndef fix_robot_command(grid, command):\n    def is_valid_move(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] != '#'\n\n    def execute_command(cmd):\n        nonlocal x, y\n        if cmd == 'L':\n            if is_valid_move(x, y - 1):\n                y -= 1\n        elif cmd == 'R':\n            if is_valid_move(x, y + 1):\n                y += 1\n        elif cmd == 'U':\n            if is_valid_move(x - 1, y):\n                x -= 1\n        elif cmd == 'D':\n            if is_valid_move(x + 1, y):\n                x += 1\n\n    changes = 0\n    for i in range(len(command)):\n        x, y = start_x, start_y\n        for j in range(len(command)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            execute_command(command[j])\n        if x == goal_x and y == goal_y:\n            return changes\n        changes += 1\n\n    return changes\n\n# Input\nH, W = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input() for _ in range(H)]\ncommand = input().strip()\n\n# Find start and goal positions\nfor i in range(H):\n    for j in range(W):\n        if grid[i][j] == 'S':\n            start_x, start_y = i, j\n        elif grid[i][j] == 'G':\n            goal_x, goal_y = i, j\n\n# Output\nprint(fix_robot_command(grid, command))\n```", "index": 0}

Hogwarts has a single room of movable staircases connecting the $N$ floors. There are $M$ staircases in total, and no two staircases connect the same pair of floors (and, obviously, a staircase would not connect a floor to itself \u2013 these are smart magic staircases with dignity). The only way to manipulate the staircases is by pressing red and green buttons located on each floor. The floors are labeled in some manner by the integers $0$ through $N-1$. Pressing the red button on floor $i$ ($0\\leq i \\leq N-1$) has the following effect on the staircases. Any staircase that is currently not connected to floor $i$ does not move. Suppose a staircase connects floors $i$ and $j$ ($j \\neq i$). After pressing the red button on floor $i$, it will instead connect floors $i$ and $j+1 \\bmod N$ \u2013 unless $j+1\\bmod N = i$, in which case it will connect floors $i$ and $j+2 \\bmod N =i+1 \\bmod N$ instead. Pressing the green button is simply the inverse operation of pressing the red one on the same floor (or, equivalently, the same as pressing the red one $N-2$ times).\n\nWhile alone, the staircases got all messed up.

We need you to help choose the dates for years $2019$, $2020$, \u2026, $2018+Z$.\n\nThere are Fridays when we cannot schedule the contest because of conflicting events. In particular, the contest cannot be held on the Friday before Canadian Thanksgiving; that date is sacred. A list of additional \u201cforbidden dates\u201d is provided, but every year there is at least one Friday in October when the contest can be held.\n\nNot all contest schedules are equally good. People tend to expect the contest to be held on or near the date it was held in the previous year. For example, they don\u2019t like to be surprised when they expect a date in early October but the contest runs late in the month, etc. There is a yearly \u201csurprise penalty\u201d for holding the contest on October $X$ one year when it had been on October $Y$ the year before, namely $(X-Y)^2$, which penalizes big surprises much more than little ones.\n\nYour goal is to find a schedule for the $Z$ years following $2018$ such that the total of the yearly surprise penalties is as small as possible.Useful facts:\n - Canadian Thanksgiving is always the second Monday in October.\n - January\u00a0$1$, $2019$, is a Tuesday.\n - Years have $365$ days, except leap years, which have an extra day in February.\n - From $2018$ until the year $2400$ (exclusive), a leap year is any year divisible by $4$ but not divisible by $100$.\n - January\u00a0$1$ is the $1^{\\textrm{st}}$ day of the year, and October\u00a0$1$ is the $274^{\\textrm{th}}$ day of $2018$.\n - October has $31$ days.\n - The contest was held on October $12$, $2018$.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The first line of the input is the integer $Z$ $(1 \\leq Z \\leq 100)$, the number of years following $2018$ for which the contest is to be scheduled.\n - The second line contains an integer $F$ $(0 \\leq F \\leq 50)$, the number of forbidden dates.\n - The following $F$ lines contain the forbidden dates, one per line. Each forbidden date is represented by three space-separated numbers:\n - The first number consists of $4$ digits and represents the year. It is between $2019$ and $2118$, inclusive.\n - The second number is always $10$, representing October.\n - The third number consists of two digits and represents the day in October.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 250 185 230\n0 185 250\n\nOutput\n1\n230\n\nInput\n4 250 185 230\n0 20 185 250\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n2 300 185 230\n0 300\n\nOutput\n2\n185 230\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.\n\nIn the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.\n\nIn the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks.

In a few moments they were ready, and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks hit the road.\n\nWe assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane. The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x_1, y_1), and the distress signal came from the point (x_2, y_2).\n\nDue to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ meters per second.\n\nOf course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (v_{x}, v_{y}) for the nearest t seconds, and then will change to (w_{x}, w_{y}). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (x, y), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (u_{x}, u_{y}) is blowing, then after $T$ seconds the new position of the dirigible will be $(x + \\tau \\cdot u_{x}, y + \\tau \\cdot u_{y})$.\n\nGadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally. He coped with the task easily, but Dale is convinced that Chip has given the random value, aiming only not to lose the face in front of Gadget. Dale has asked you to find the right answer.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the speed of the wind at any moment of time is strictly less than the maximum possible speed of the airship relative to the air.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (|x_1|,  |y_1|,  |x_2|,  |y_2| \u2264 10 000)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the rescuers' headquarters and the point, where signal of the distress came from, respectively. \n\nThe second line contains two integers $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ and t (0 < v, t \u2264 1000), which are denoting the maximum speed of the chipmunk dirigible relative to the air and the moment of time when the wind changes according to the weather forecast, respectively. \n\nNext follow one per line two pairs of integer (v_{x}, v_{y}) and (w_{x}, w_{y}), describing the wind for the first t seconds and the wind that will blow at all the remaining time, respectively. It is guaranteed that $v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2} < v_{\\operatorname{max}}^{2}$ and $w_{x}^{2} + w_{y}^{2} < v_{\\operatorname{max}}^{2}$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single real value\u00a0\u2014 the minimum time the rescuers need to get to point (x_2, y_2). You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. \n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0 5 5\n3 2\n-1 -1\n-1 0\n\nOutput\n3.729935587093555327\n\nInput\n0 0 0 1000\n100 1000\n-50 0\n50 0\n\nOutput\n11.547005383792516398", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLhYsY5EGSSwDXFN5AQESCSyFh", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nimport math\n\nx1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nv_max, t = map(int, input().split())\nvx, vy = map(int, input().split())\nwx, wy = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef time_to_reach_destination(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, t, vx, vy, wx, wy):\n    def time_to_destination_with_wind(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, vx, vy, wx, wy):\n        dx = x2 - x1\n        dy = y2 - y1\n        a = vx ** 2 + vy ** 2 - v_max ** 2\n        b = 2 * (dx * vx + dy * vy)\n        c = dx ** 2 + dy ** 2\n        D = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c\n        if D < 0:\n            return float('inf')\n        t1 = (-b + math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)\n        t2 = (-b - math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)\n        if t1 >= 0:\n            return t1\n        elif t2 >= 0:\n            return t2\n        else:\n            return float('inf')\n\n    time_with_wind = time_to_destination_with_wind(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, vx, vy, wx, wy)\n    if t >= time_with_wind:\n        return time_with_wind\n    else:\n        time_without_wind = distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) / v_max\n        return t + time_without_wind\n\nresult = time_to_reach_destination(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, t, vx, vy, wx, wy)\nprint(result)\n```\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 906, "completion_tokens": 440, "total_tokens": 1346}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35"}, "response": "```python\nimport math\n\nx1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nv_max, t = map(int, input().split())\nvx, vy = map(int, input().split())\nwx, wy = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)\n\ndef time_to_reach_destination(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, t, vx, vy, wx, wy):\n    def time_to_destination_with_wind(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, vx, vy, wx, wy):\n        dx = x2 - x1\n        dy = y2 - y1\n        a = vx ** 2 + vy ** 2 - v_max ** 2\n        b = 2 * (dx * vx + dy * vy)\n        c = dx ** 2 + dy ** 2\n        D = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c\n        if D < 0:\n            return float('inf')\n        t1 = (-b + math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)\n        t2 = (-b - math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)\n        if t1 >= 0:\n            return t1\n        elif t2 >= 0:\n            return t2\n        else:\n            return float('inf')\n\n    time_with_wind = time_to_destination_with_wind(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, vx, vy, wx, wy)\n    if t >= time_with_wind:\n        return time_with_wind\n    else:\n        time_without_wind = distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) / v_max\n        return t + time_without_wind\n\nresult = time_to_reach_destination(x1, y1, x2, y2, v_max, t, vx, vy, wx, wy)\nprint(result)\n```\n```", "index": 0}

Polycarpus cannot tell the letters, which are already revealed.\n\nYour task is to help Polycarpus and find out the number of letters he can tell so that the show host will assuredly reveal at least one of the remaining letters.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the hidden word.\n\nThe following line describes already revealed letters. It contains the string of length n, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and symbols \"*\". If there is a letter at some position, then this letter was already revealed. If the position contains symbol \"*\", then the letter at this position has not been revealed yet. It is guaranteed, that at least one letter is still closed.\n\nThe third line contains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of words of length n, which Polycarpus knows.

He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.\n\nThe path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate $n$ km.\n\nDriving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \\in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \\le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.\n\nFortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it \u2014 difficulty $a_2$, and so on.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one \u2014 $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth \u2014 $a_2$, and the last one \u2014 $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\nLeha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites.

{"name": "3238", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nGold Leaf is a very thin layer of gold, with a paper backing. If the paper gets folded and then unfolded, the gold leaf will stick to itself more readily than it will stick to the paper, so there will be patches of gold and patches of exposed paper. Note that the gold leaf will always stick to itself, rather than the paper. In the following example, the paper was folded along the dashed line. Notice how the gold leaf always sticks to one side or the other, never both.\n\nConsider a crude digital image of a sheet of gold leaf. If the area covered by a pixel is mostly gold, that will be represented by a \u2018#\u2019. If it\u2019s mostly exposed paper, it will be represented by a \u2018.\u2019. Determine where the sheet was folded. The sheet was folded exactly once, along a horizontal, vertical, or 45 degree or 135 degree diagonal line. If the fold is horizontal or vertical, it is always between rows/columns. If the fold is diagonal, then the fold goes through a diagonal line of cells, and the cells along the fold are always \u2018#\u2019.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case.

Each of the next $n$ lines will contain exactly $m$ characters, all of which will be either \u2018#\u2019 or \u2018.\u2019. This represents a crudely collected digital image of the sheet of gold leaf. There is guaranteed to be at least one \u2018.\u2019, and there is guaranteed to be a solution.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with four integers, indicating the places where the fold hits the edges of the paper.

The top left character of the image is $(1,1)$ and the bottom right is $(n,m)$.\n\nIf the fold is horizontal or diagonal, list the left coordinates before the right. If the fold is vertical, list the top coordinates before the bottom.\n\nIf the fold is horizontal, use the coordinates above the fold. If the fold is vertical, use the coordinates to the left of the fold.

{"name": "3130", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nSherlock Holmes is a renowned detective. His Scotland Yard colleagues often provide him with a set of evidence and ask for his help in solving the mysteries. After many years of practice, Holmes has gained an enormous amount of experience and already knows causes for many common events, which, combined with his extraordinary deductive capabilities, enables him to solve cases in a matter of minutes, from the comfort of his chair.\n\nHolmes\u2019 knowledge base can be modeled as a set of implications of the form $A \\rightarrow B$ (where $A$ and $B$ represent events), which means that, if $A$ occurred, event $B$ must have also occurred (remember that logical implication is false only if $A$ is true and $B$ is false). Of course, implications can form chains of reasoning, e.g., $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$. However, there will never be a circular chain of implications (e.g., $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow A$).\n\nHolmes is given a set $S = \\{ S_1, S_2, S_3, \\ldots , S_ n \\} $ of events that are known to have occurred. He can then, using his extensive knowledge and deductive powers, find all events that have certainly occurred.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Holmes\u2019 knowledge is so mind-bogglingly huge that he knows all possible causes of events. In other words, there is no implication that is true, but not included in Holmes\u2019 knowledge base. This means that if an event $A$ occurred and $A$ is known to be implied by some other event(s), then at least one of those other event(s) must have occurred as well.\n\nMany detective agencies would highly appreciate Holmes\u2019 one of a kind capabilities, so you were given a task to accomplish with a computer what is out of reach for ordinary mortals. Write a program to find all events that have certainly occurred based on the given implications and evidence collected by your colleague detectives.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of three integers, $D$ ($1 \\le D \\le 1000$), the number of different types of events, $M$ ($1 \\le M \\le 100000$), the number of implications, and $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le D$), the number of events known to have occurred.\n\nEach of the $M$ lines that follow contains two integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\le A, B \\le D$), describing an implication $A \\rightarrow B$.\n\nFinally, each of the last $N$ lines contains an integer $X$ ($1 \\le X \\le D$) describing an event that is known to have occurred, based on the evidence collected by detectives.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output should contain integers (in increasing order) representing events that have certainly occurred.\n\n-----Explanation of sample cases-----\nIn Sample Input 2, the knowledge base contains implications $1 \\rightarrow 3$ and $2 \\rightarrow 3$. Therefore, Holmes knows that event $3$ can be caused only by events $1$ and $2$, but (without any extra information), he can\u2019t be certain which one of those events actually caused $3$. As a result, the only event that must have occurred is the one given in the input.\n\nIn Sample Input 3, Holmes doesn\u2019t know which event from the set $\\{ 2, 3\\} $ is directly responsible for event $4$. However, as both of those events are caused only by event $1$, Holmes can deduce that event $1$ must have occurred. As a consequence, events $2$, $3$ and $4$ (given by the detectives) have also occurred.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2 1\n1 2\n2 3\n2\nSample Output 1:\n1 2 3\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 2 1\n1 3\n2 3\n3\nSample Output 2:\n3", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfL1cCUS4rbqVS9E4tAS1NeaX7u", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nD, M, N = map(int, input().split())\nimplications = {}\nfor _ in range(M):\n    A, B = map(int, input().split())\n    if B not in implications:\n        implications[B] = set()\n    implications[B].add(A)\n\nknown_events = set()\nfor _ in range(N):\n    known_events.add(int(input()))\n\nevents_occurred = set()\nfor event in known_events:\n    events_occurred.add(event)\n    if event in implications:\n        for cause in implications[event]:\n            events_occurred.add(cause)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, sorted(events_occurred))))\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 865, "completion_tokens": 130, "total_tokens": 995}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4f0b692a78"}, "response": "```python\nD, M, N = map(int, input().split())\nimplications = {}\nfor _ in range(M):\n    A, B = map(int, input().split())\n    if B not in implications:\n        implications[B] = set()\n    implications[B].add(A)\n\nknown_events = set()\nfor _ in range(N):\n    known_events.add(int(input()))\n\nevents_occurred = set()\nfor event in known_events:\n    events_occurred.add(event)\n    if event in implications:\n        for cause in implications[event]:\n            events_occurred.add(cause)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, sorted(events_occurred))))\n```", "index": 0}
{"name": "4742", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nIn the past century, a new style of music composition has emerged. Unlike more traditional methods based on keys and chords, the technique known as dodecaphony focuses on using all twelve notes equally. As a quick reminder, the twelve notes, in ascending order are,\\[ C, C\\sharp , D, D\\sharp , E, F, F\\sharp , G, G\\sharp , A, A\\sharp , B \\]\n\nThe sequence then wraps around so that the next note after $B$ is $C$ and so on. For this problem, we\u2019ll ignore equivalent notations that use flats, double sharps, or double flats.\n\nEach successive note above is considered one semitone away from the next. Now in our simplified version of dodecaphony, a melody is a permutation of the previous melody by one of three relations.\n\nFirst, we have transposition, where each note has been shifted up by $n$ semitones. A retrograde is when the notes have their order reversed. Finally we have inversion about the first note of the melody. With inversions, the first note doesn\u2019t change, but the rest of the notes are inverted such that the the interval (number of semitones) between that note and the first note is negated.\n\nFor example, if $F$ is our first note, and we want to invert an $A\\sharp $, which is $5$ semitones higher, the inverted note would be a $C$, which is $5$ semitones lower. Note that the first note in an inverted melody is always just the first note of the original melody.\n\nGiven two melodies, can you tell what relation the second has to the first?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $2 \\leq l \\leq 50$, the number of notes in each melody.\n\nThe next two lines each contain $l$ space separated notes.

Thus the chain reaction began.\n\nThe chain reaction takes place in the following way:\n - if a string contains explosions, they all explode and a new string is formed by concatenating the pieces without the exploding parts\n - this concatenation could possibly create new explosions\n - the chain reaction repeats while there are explosions in the string\n\nNow Mirko wants to know whether anything will be left after this series of chain reactions.

Then we are left with ****1****2ab (where * marks the character that exploded) and when that string is put together, we get 12ab.

{"name": "2925", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nYour slightly pointy-bearded boss has assigned you to write software to find the best songs from different music albums. And the software should be finished in an hour. But don\u2019t panic, you don\u2019t have to solve the problem of writing an AI with good taste. At your disposal is the impeccable taste of a vast horde of long-tailed monkeys. Well, at least almost. The monkeys are not very communicative (or rather, you\u2019re not sure which song \u201cOok!\u201d is supposed to refer to) so you can\u2019t ask them which songs are the best. What you can do however is to look at which songs the monkeys have listened to and use this information to deduce which songs are the best. \n\nAt first, you figure that the most listened to songs must be the best songs. However, you quickly realize that this approach is flawed. Even if all songs of the album are equally good, the early songs are more likely to be listened to more often than the later ones, because monkeys will tend to start listening to the first song, listen for a few songs and then, when their fickle ears start craving something else, stop listening. Instead, if all songs are equal, you expect that their play frequencies should follow Zipf\u2019s Law.\n\nZipf\u2019s Law is an empirical law originally formulated about word frequencies in natural languages, but it has been observed that many natural phenomena, such as population sizes and incomes, approximately follow the same law. It predicts that the relative frequency of the $i$\u2019th most common object (in this case, a song) should be proportional to $1/i$.\n\nTo illustrate this in our setting, suppose we have an album where all songs are equally good. Then by Zipf\u2019s Law, you expect that the first song is listened to twice as often as the second song, and more generally that the first song is listened to $i$ times as often as the $i$\u2019th song. When some songs are better than others, those will be listened to more often than predicted by Zipf\u2019s Law, and those are the songs your program should select as the good songs. Specifically, suppose that song $i$ has been played $f_ i$ times but that Zipf\u2019s Law predicts that it would have been played $z_ i$ times. Then you define the quality of song $i$ to be $q_ i = f_ i/z_ i$. Your software should select the songs with the highest values of $q_ i$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50000$, $1 \\le m \\le n$), the number of songs on the album, and the number of songs to select. Then follow $n$ lines. The $i$\u2019th of these lines contains an integer $f_ i$ and string $s_ i$, where $0 \\le f_ i \\le 10^{12}$ is the number of times the $i$\u2019th song was listened to, and $s_ i$ is the name of the song. Each song name is at most $30$ characters long and consists only of the characters \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019, \u20180\u2019-\u20189\u2019, and underscore (\u2018_\u2019).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of the $m$ songs with the highest quality $q_ i$, in decreasing order of quality.

As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules:  Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below.  During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2.  Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p.  All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p. \n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere.

{"name": "3422", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nYou may be under the impression that treasure maps originate from pirates, who create maps after burying their treasure so that they will later have a way to retrieve their stolen fortunes. In reality, it is extremely rare for pirates to bury treasure; there are only a few such documented cases.\n\nAs it turns out, the vast majority of treasure maps are published by the Mapping Association of Plunder and Spoils (MAPS), a secretive group of people responsible for curating reports of lost or stolen treasure and then making and selling corresponding treasure maps.\n\nOver the years, MAPS has become increasingly creative with the structure of its treasure maps, so these maps no longer resemble a stereotypical treasure map. In fact, they no longer come in one piece; treasure hunters must assemble a map from multiple pieces before being able to use it to locate buried treasure.\n\nFormally, an assembled treasure map is a rectangular grid of squares, where each square indicates the rectilinear distance (sum of horizontal distance and vertical distance) to the square containing the treasure, modulo $10$.\n\nGiven a list of smaller rectangular map pieces, you must rearrange the pieces to reconstruct a valid rectangular map, rotating (but not flipping) the pieces as needed. Every map piece must be used exactly once in the reconstructed map, no two map pieces may overlap, and the reconstructed map must not contain any gaps.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer, $N$ ($2\\leq N\\leq 8$), indicating the number of rectangular map pieces. This is followed by a series of lines describing each map piece. The description of the $i$-th piece ($1\\leq i\\leq N$) begins with a line containing two space-separated integers, $W_ i$ and $H_ i$, giving the $i$-th piece\u2019s width and height, respectively, where $1\\leq W_ i, H_ i\\leq 10$. This is followed by $H_ i$ lines of $W_ i$ characters each, where each character represents one square of the map piece (using a digit from $0$ to $9$, inclusive). It is guaranteed that one of the map pieces contains a square corresponding to the location of the treasure.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a line containing $W$ and $H$, separated by a single space, where $W$ is the width and $H$ is the height of a valid reconstructed map (such a reconstruction will always be possible). Then output the reconstructed map as $H$ lines of $W$ characters each. (In the event that there are multiple possible maps that can be produced, it suffices to output any one of them, in any of the $4$ possible rotations.) On the following line, output $W$ hyphen (\u2018-\u2019) characters. Then output $H$ lines of $W$ characters each, where each character is a digit between $1$ and $N$, inclusive, that is the ($1$-based) index of the map piece to which the corresponding square in the reconstructed map belongs.

He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). \n\nThere are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\n\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0.

Unfortunately for the troll, eventually the king got wind of its questionable business model, and sent out the valiant knights of the High Tavern to go, shall we say, Queen of Hearts, on the troll. \n\nApprehensive of its imminent decapitation, the troll fled, and did not have the decency to even leave a forwarding address.

Since a group needed to be able to avoid being eaten once the troll was found, each group had to consist of at least a certain number of knights.

To secure a revered lifetime appointment as antenna calibrator for the dank.nt.nu pirate radio station (broadcasted live from the Gl\u00f8shaugen catacombs every night at 00:13:37 CET), you have been challenged to produce a $256$-minute feature revealing the character type of each candidate.\n\nIt is well known any candidate is either a truther, who always tells the truth, a fabulist, who never tells the truth, or a charlatan, who starts any debate speaking truthfully, but eventually switches to uttering only falsehoods. (Precisely, a charlatan first utters one or more true statements, then she utters one or more false statements, and that is all.)\n\nNow, as should be expected candidates talk nothing about printer maintenance policy, but about only each other\u2019s character types. In particular, candidates utter propositions using the following language:\n - truther\u00a0<n>, where <n> is a name of a candidate, which is true if <n> is the name of a truther\n - fabulist\u00a0<n>, where <n> is a name of a candidate, which is true if <n> is the name of a fabulist\n - charlatan\u00a0<n>, where <n> is a name of a candidate, which is true if <n> is the name of a charlatan\n - not\u00a0<p>, where <p> is a proposition, which is true if <p> is false\n - and\u00a0<p>\u00a0<q>, where <p> and <q> are propositions, which is true if both <p> and <q> are true\n - xor\u00a0<p>\u00a0<q>, where <p> and <q> are propositions, which is true if one of <p> or <q> is false and the other one is true\n\nIt is somewhat strange the relatively brainy electorate has not been able to determine the correct character types of the candidates, as that is indeed always possible given the transcript of a debate.

The next $K$ lines describe the utterances in the debate, sorted by time; the first such line describes the first utterance of the debate. Each such line consists of an integer, denoting the name of the speaker of the utterance, and the uttered statement, expressed in the language described above. Adjacent tokens on the same line will be separated by exactly one space character.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $N$ lines.

Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,  - 2), (3,  - 4), (1, 3), (1,  - 2, 1, 3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then:   the first flower adds 1\u00b71 = 1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,  the second flower adds ( - 2)\u00b71 =  - 2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,  the third flower adds 1\u00b72 = 2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,  the fourth flower adds 3\u00b72 = 6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,  the fifth flower adds ( - 4)\u00b70 = 0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. \n\nThus, in total 1 + ( - 2) + 2 + 6 + 0 = 7 is added to the girl's happiness.

{"name": "2785", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nBeing a responsible young adult, you have decided to start planning for retirement. Doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations, you figured out you need at least $M$ euros to retire comfortably.\n\nYou are currently broke, but fortunately a generous gazillionaire friend has offered to lend you an arbitrary amount of money (as much as you need), without interest, to invest in the stock market. After making some profit you will then return the original sum to your friend, leaving you with the remainder.\n\nAvailable to you are $n$ investment opportunities, the $i$-th of which costs $c_ i$ euros. You also used your computer science skills to predict that the $i$-th investment will earn you $p_ i$ euros per day. What is the minimum number of days you need before you can pay back your friend and retire? You can only invest once in each investment opportunity, but you can invest in as many different investment opportunities as you like.\n\nFor example, consider the first sample. If you buy only the second investment (which costs $15$ euros) you will earn $p_2 = 10$ euros per day.

The problem statement is:\n\nGiven an undirected tree consisting of n nodes, find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges. Formally, we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge (u, v) that belongs to the tree, either u is in the set, or v is in the set, or both are in the set. Mahmoud has found the following algorithm:  Root the tree at node 1.  Count the number of nodes at an even depth. Let it be evenCnt.  Count the number of nodes at an odd depth. Let it be oddCnt.  The answer is the minimum between evenCnt and oddCnt. \n\nThe depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root. The depth of the root is 0.\n\nEhab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong, but he didn't believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked, so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting of n nodes.

Namely, the Olympiad number i should be prepared by p_{i} people for t_{i} days, the preparation for the Olympiad should be a continuous period of time and end exactly one day before the Olympiad. On the day of the Olympiad the juries who have prepared it, already do not work on it.\n\nFor example, if the Olympiad is held on December 9th and the preparation takes 7 people and 6 days, all seven members of the jury will work on the problems of the Olympiad from December, 3rd to December, 8th (the jury members won't be working on the problems of this Olympiad on December 9th, that is, some of them can start preparing problems for some other Olympiad).

{"name": "3226", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nThe Newton brothers are planning to rob a bank in the city of Alviso and want to figure out a way to escape the city\u2019s only police car. They know that their car is faster than the police car so if they could just reach one of the highways exiting the city they will be able to speed away from the police.\n\nThe police car has a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Luckily, the brothers know where the police car will start (it\u2019s parked at the police station). To be on the safe side they assume that the police car will start moving as soon as they leave the bank and start their car (this is when the alarm goes off).\n\nThe brothers want to find a fixed route that ensures that they are able to leave the city no matter what route the police car take and at what speed it drives. However, since the brothers are not very confident drivers they don\u2019t want to drive faster than necessary. Luckily they have recently invested in a new hi-tech in-car police escape system that you have constructed. This system will tell them what the minimal top speed needed to escape is (and probably other useful things like what route to take).\n\nLet\u2019s turn the clock back a bit to the time when you were constructing the escape system and focused on finding the minimal required speed. Can you get it right?\n\nYou may treat all roads as infinitesimally narrow and both cars as point objects. If the brothers ever end up at the same point (on any road or intersection) at the same time as the police car they will be caught and by Murphy\u2019s law if there is any possibility of this happening it will happen. The two cars start simultaneously and can accelerate/decelerate instantaneously at any time to any speed below or equal to its maximum speed. They can also change roads at intersections or direction anywhere on a road instantaneously no matter what speed they are traveling at.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $e$, where $2 \\le n \\le 100$ describe the number of intersections, $1 \\le m \\le 5000$ describes the number of roads in the city and $1 \\le e \\le n$ describes the number of highway exits. Then follow $m$ lines, each consisting of three integers $a,b,l$ such that $1 \\le a < b \\le n$ and $1 \\le l \\le 100$ describing a road of length $l$ hundred meters from intersection $a$ to intersection $b$. Then follows a line of $e$ integers, each one a number in $1, \\ldots , n$ describing which intersections are connected to highway exits. Finally there is a line with two integers $b$ and $p$ ($1 \\le b,p \\le n \\text { and } b \\neq p$) describing the intersections where the brothers and the police cars start, respectively.\n\nIt will always be possible to travel from any intersection to any other intersection. Roads are only connected at intersection points (although they may cross using bridges or tunnels at others points). Roads can be used in both directions but there cannot be more than one road between two intersections.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe minimal speed in km/h required to escape or the word IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible. In the first case any answer with either absolute or relative error smaller than $10^{-6}$ is acceptable.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2 1\n1 2 7\n2 3 8\n1\n3 2\nSample Output 1:\nIMPOSSIBLE\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 2 1\n1 2 7\n2 3 8\n1\n2 3\nSample Output 2:\n74.6666666667", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLek1WXP5CjTvixiWoeZYJFsCr", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    n = len(graph)\n    dist = [float('inf')] * n\n    dist[start] = 0\n    pq = [(0, start)]\n    \n    while pq:\n        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if d > dist[u]:\n            continue\n        for v, w in graph[u]:\n            if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:\n                dist[v] = dist[u] + w\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))\n    \n    return dist\n\ndef escape_speed(n, m, e, roads, exits, b, p):\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for a, b, l in roads:\n        graph[a-1].append((b-1, l))\n        graph[b-1].append((a-1, l))\n    \n    dist_brothers = dijkstra(graph, b-1)\n    dist_police = dijkstra(graph, p-1)\n    \n    min_speed = float('inf')\n    for exit_intersection in exits:\n        min_speed = min(min_speed, (dist_police[exit_intersection-1] - dist_brothers[exit_intersection-1]) / dist_brothers[exit_intersection-1])\n    \n    if min_speed >= 0:\n        return min_speed * 160\n    else:\n        return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n\n# Input parsing\nn, m, e = map(int, input().split())\nroads = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]\nexits = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb, p = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate and output the minimal speed required to escape\nprint(escape_speed(n, m, e, roads, exits, b, p))\n```\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 797, "completion_tokens": 391, "total_tokens": 1188}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_b9d4cef803"}, "response": "```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    n = len(graph)\n    dist = [float('inf')] * n\n    dist[start] = 0\n    pq = [(0, start)]\n    \n    while pq:\n        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if d > dist[u]:\n            continue\n        for v, w in graph[u]:\n            if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:\n                dist[v] = dist[u] + w\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))\n    \n    return dist\n\ndef escape_speed(n, m, e, roads, exits, b, p):\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for a, b, l in roads:\n        graph[a-1].append((b-1, l))\n        graph[b-1].append((a-1, l))\n    \n    dist_brothers = dijkstra(graph, b-1)\n    dist_police = dijkstra(graph, p-1)\n    \n    min_speed = float('inf')\n    for exit_intersection in exits:\n        min_speed = min(min_speed, (dist_police[exit_intersection-1] - dist_brothers[exit_intersection-1]) / dist_brothers[exit_intersection-1])\n    \n    if min_speed >= 0:\n        return min_speed * 160\n    else:\n        return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n\n# Input parsing\nn, m, e = map(int, input().split())\nroads = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]\nexits = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb, p = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate and output the minimal speed required to escape\nprint(escape_speed(n, m, e, roads, exits, b, p))\n```\n```", "index": 0}

In this problem you are asked to set up wireless network coverage for an entire office floor plan. The floor plan can be viewed as an $N\\times M$ grid. Each grid cell represents a single office. Each pair of adjacent offices (cells that share a side) are connected by a corridor. You may install routers in some of the offices. Each installed router provides wireless network for the (at most four) corridors that are incident to the office where the router is located. Installing routers at different offices may have different costs.\n\nHowever, some issues arise. If neither of the two offices incident to a corridor has a router, the corridor would have weak signal. If both of the two offices incident to a corridor have a router, the corridor would have conflicting signals that would cause both routers to be inaccessible from the corridor. (Unfortunately the routers available are pretty old models that do not collaborate very well.) Consequently, for every corridor that has either weak or conflicting signal, you must additionally install a cellular hub, which provides separate wireless service (that uses cellular network and is independent of the routers).

The architecture was the paralellepiped of size n \u00d7 m \u00d7 k, split into 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to n, the line number from 1 to m and the column number from 1 to k.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (x, y, z) can send messages to CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) cannot send messages to CPU (x, y, z).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages. We will say that CPU (a, b, c) controls CPU (d, e, f) , if there is a chain of CPUs (x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}), such that (x_1 = a, y_1 = b, z_1 = c), (x_{p} = d, y_{p} = e, z_{p} = f) (here and below p is the length of the chain) and the CPU in the chain with number i (i < p) can send messages to CPU i + 1.\n\nTurtles are quite concerned about the denial-proofness of the system of communication between the remaining CPUs. For that they want to know the number of critical CPUs. A CPU (x, y, z) is critical, if turning it off will disrupt some control, that is, if there are two distinctive from (x, y, z) CPUs: (a, b, c) and (d, e, f), such that (a, b, c) controls (d, e, f) before (x, y, z) is turned off and stopped controlling it after the turning off.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m, k \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the dimensions of the Super Computer. \n\nThen n blocks follow, describing the current state of the processes.

Each block consists of m lines, k characters in each \u2014 the description of a layer in the format of an m \u00d7 k table. Thus, the state of the CPU (x, y, z) is corresponded to the z-th character of the y-th line of the block number x.

{"name": "3229", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nYou are participating in a programming contest cup. The cup consists of a series of programming contests, followed by a final at the end of the season for the $15$ top ranked contestants in the cup. With only one contest left to go before the final, you are starting to wonder if your performance in the earlier contests has been good enough to already secure you a spot in the finals. If so, you could succumb to your laziness and skip the last contest.\n\nThe ranking of the cup works as follows. In each contest, a contestant earns some number of points between $0$ and $101$ (the details of this are described below). Their aggregate score is then defined to be the sum of the four highest scores achieved. For instance if a contestant got $45$, $15$, $32$, $0$, $30$, and $20$ points over $6$ contests, their aggregate score is $45+32+30+20=127$. The rank of a contestant X in the cup is defined to be $1$ plus the number of contestants that have a strictly larger aggregate score than X.\n\nThe score a contestant earns from a contest is based on the rank they achieve in that contest, according to the following table.\n\nRank\n\nPoints\n\nRank\n\nPoints\n\nRank\n\nPoints\n\n$1$\n\n$100$\n\n$11$\n\n$24$\n\n$21$\n\n$10$\n\n$2$\n\n$75$\n\n$12$\n\n$22$\n\n$22$\n\n$9$\n\n$3$\n\n$60$\n\n$13$\n\n$20$\n\n$23$\n\n$8$\n\n$4$\n\n$50$\n\n$14$\n\n$18$\n\n$24$\n\n$7$\n\n$5$\n\n$45$\n\n$15$\n\n$16$\n\n$25$\n\n$6$\n\n$6$\n\n$40$\n\n$16$\n\n$15$\n\n$26$\n\n$5$\n\n$7$\n\n$36$\n\n$17$\n\n$14$\n\n$27$\n\n$4$\n\n$8$\n\n$32$\n\n$18$\n\n$13$\n\n$28$\n\n$3$\n\n$9$\n\n$29$\n\n$19$\n\n$12$\n\n$29$\n\n$2$\n\n$10$\n\n$26$\n\n$20$\n\n$11$\n\n$30$\n\n$1$\n\nIf a contestant gets a worse rank than $30$, they get $0$ points. If two or more contestants get the same rank in the contest, they are instead assigned the average points of all the corresponding ranks. This average is always rounded up to the closest integer. For example, if three contestants are tied for second place they all receive $\\lceil \\frac{75 + 60 + 50}{3} \\rceil = 62$ points, and the next contestant will have rank $5$ and receives $45$ points (or less, if there is a tie also for $5$\u2019th place). This applies also at rank $30$, e.g., if $4711$ contestants are tied for $30$\u2019th place, they all receive $1$ point.\n\nContestants may participate in every contest either on-site or online. If they compete on-site, they get $1$ extra point, no matter their original number of points.

Each such line consists of $n-1$ integers $0 \\le s_1, \\ldots , s_{n-1} \\le 101$, where $s_ i$ is the score that this contestant received in the $i$th contest.\n\nThe first contestant listed is you.

If number t_{i} equals 0, then the current candy is a caramel drop, otherwise it is a fruit drop.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Om Nom can eat.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n0 2 4\n1 3 1\n0 8 3\n0 20 10\n1 5 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne of the possible ways to eat 4 candies is to eat them in the order: 1, 5, 3, 2. Let's assume the following scenario:  Initially, the height of Om Nom's jump equals 3. He can reach candies 1 and 2. Let's assume that he eats candy 1. As the mass of this candy equals 4, the height of his jump will rise to 3 + 4 = 7.  Now Om Nom can reach candies 2 and 5. Let's assume that he eats candy 5. Then the height of his jump will be 7 + 5 = 12.  At this moment, Om Nom can reach two candies, 2 and 3. He won't eat candy 2 as its type matches the type of the previously eaten candy. Om Nom eats candy 3, the height of his jump is 12 + 3 = 15.  Om Nom eats candy 2, the height of his jump is 15 + 1 = 16.

Maybe the cause of it is the excess of vitamins, or maybe it is some black magic...\n\nTo prevent this, Alice decided to go to the hairdresser. She wants for her hair length to be at most $l$ centimeters after haircut, where $l$ is her favorite number. Suppose, that the Alice's head is a straight line on which $n$ hairlines grow. Let's number them from $1$ to $n$. With one swing of the scissors the hairdresser can shorten all hairlines on any segment to the length $l$, given that all hairlines on that segment had length strictly greater than $l$. The hairdresser wants to complete his job as fast as possible, so he will make the least possible number of swings of scissors, since each swing of scissors takes one second.\n\nAlice hasn't decided yet when she would go to the hairdresser, so she asked you to calculate how much time the haircut would take depending on the time she would go to the hairdresser.

{"name": "1520", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nRoman and Denis are on the trip to the programming competition. Since the trip was long, they soon got bored, and hence decided to came up with something. Roman invented a pizza's recipe, while Denis invented a string multiplication. According to Denis, the result of multiplication (product) of strings $s$ of length $m$ and $t$ is a string $t + s_1 + t + s_2 + \\ldots + t + s_m + t$, where $s_i$ denotes the $i$-th symbol of the string $s$, and \"+\" denotes string concatenation. For example, the product of strings \"abc\" and \"de\" is a string \"deadebdecde\", while the product of the strings \"ab\" and \"z\" is a string \"zazbz\". Note, that unlike the numbers multiplication, the product of strings $s$ and $t$ is not necessarily equal to product of $t$ and $s$.\n\nRoman was jealous of Denis, since he invented such a cool operation, and hence decided to invent something string-related too. Since Roman is beauty-lover, he decided to define the beauty of the string as the length of the longest substring, consisting of only one letter. For example, the beauty of the string \"xayyaaabca\" is equal to $3$, since there is a substring \"aaa\", while the beauty of the string \"qwerqwer\" is equal to $1$, since all neighboring symbols in it are different.\n\nIn order to entertain Roman, Denis wrote down $n$ strings $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$ on the paper and asked him to calculate the beauty of the string $( \\ldots (((p_1 \\cdot p_2) \\cdot p_3) \\cdot \\ldots ) \\cdot p_n$, where $s \\cdot t$ denotes a multiplication of strings $s$ and $t$.

{"name": "3543", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nTyping on phones can be tedious. It is easy to make typing mistakes, which is why most phones come with an autocorrect feature. Autocorrect not only fixes common typos, but also suggests how to finish the word while you type it. Jenny has recently been pondering how she can use this feature to her advantage, so that she can send a particular message with the minimum amount of typing. \n\nThe autocorrect feature on Jenny\u2019s phone works like this: the phone has an internal dictionary of words sorted by their frequency in the English language. Whenever a word is being typed, autocorrect suggests the most common word (if any) starting with all the letters typed so far. By pressing tab, the word being typed is completed with the autocorrect suggestion. Autocorrect can only be used after the first character of a word has been typed \u2013 it is not possible to press tab before having typed anything. If no dictionary word starts with the letters typed so far, pressing tab has no effect.\n\nJenny has recently noticed that it is sometimes possible to use autocorrect to her advantage even when it is not suggesting the correct word, by deleting the end of the autocorrected word. For instance, to type the word \u201cautocorrelation\u201d, Jenny starts typing \u201caut\u201d, which then autocorrects to \u201cautocorrect\u201d (because it is such a common word these days!) when pressing tab. By deleting the last two characters (\u201cct\u201d) and then typing the six letters \u201clation\u201d, the whole word can be typed using only $3$ (\u201caut\u201d) ${}+1$ (tab) ${}+2$ (backspace twice) ${}+6$ (\u201clation\u201d) $= 12$ keystrokes, $3$ fewer than typing \u201cautocorrelation\u201d without using autocorrect.\n\nGiven the dictionary on the phone and the words Jenny wants to type, output the minimum number of keystrokes required to type each word.

Then follow $m$ lines, containing the words to type.\n\nThe dictionary and the words to type only use lower case letters \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019.

But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\leq n\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of numbers in a row.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers in a row.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number\u00a0\u2014 the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 5 4 1 3\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n7\n1 2 1 1 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Sonya can give pairs ($1$, $1$), ($1$, $3$), ($1$, $4$), ($1$, $5$), ($4$, $1$), ($4$, $3$), ($5$, $1$), ($5$, $3$), and ($5$, $4$).\n\nIn the second example, Sonya can give pairs ($1$, $1$), ($1$, $2$), ($1$, $3$), ($2$, $1$), ($2$, $2$), ($2$, $3$), and ($3$, $2$).", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLEmg1l9lNwztjvF6xjc5oYmCR", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nn = int(input())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nleft_count = {}\nright_count = {}\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num not in left_count:\n        left_count[num] = 0\n    left_count[num] += 1\n\n    if num not in right_count:\n        right_count[num] = 0\n    right_count[num] += 1\n\npairs = 0\nfor num in numbers:\n    left_count[num] -= 1\n    right_count[num] -= 1\n\n    pairs += left_count[num] * right_count[num]\n\nprint(pairs)\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 842, "completion_tokens": 128, "total_tokens": 970}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4f0b692a78"}, "response": "```python\nn = int(input())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nleft_count = {}\nright_count = {}\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num not in left_count:\n        left_count[num] = 0\n    left_count[num] += 1\n\n    if num not in right_count:\n        right_count[num] = 0\n    right_count[num] += 1\n\npairs = 0\nfor num in numbers:\n    left_count[num] -= 1\n    right_count[num] -= 1\n\n    pairs += left_count[num] * right_count[num]\n\nprint(pairs)\n```", "index": 0}

{"name": "3146", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nMany pharmacies in the United States fill prescriptions strictly on a first-come, first-served basis, even preferring prescriptions submitted electronically from a remote site to prescriptions dropped off by waiting customers in the store. This frequently leads to situations where customers have to wait for prescriptions because pharmacy technicians are busy filling prescriptions that may not be picked up until much later anyway.\n\nThis problem asks you to investigate the effect of an \u201cin-store customers first\u201d policy. Under this policy, technicians fill prescriptions in the order in which they are dropped off, but they will not start filling remote prescriptions as long as there are in-store prescriptions to be filled.\n\nWrite a program that computes the average completion time for in-store and remote customers under this policy!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ ($0 < n \\le 100000$) and $t$ ($0 < T \\le 10$), where $n$ denotes the number of prescriptions and $T$ the number of technicians working at the pharmacy. This is followed by $n$ lines, one line per prescription.\n\nEach line consists of one integer $d$ ($0 < d \\le 10^9$), which is the time (in seconds) when the prescription was dropped off, followed by a single character \u2018R\u2019 or \u2018S\u2019 for a remote or in-store prescription, followed by a single integer $k$ ($0 < k \\le 500$) describing the number of seconds it takes a technician to fill this prescription. Prescriptions are listed in increasing order of drop-off time, but multiple prescriptions may be dropped off at the same time, in which case preference should be given to any in-store prescriptions, regardless of the order in which they appear in the input. If two prescriptions of the same type are dropped off at the same time, the prescription needing the shorter fill time must be filled first, again regardless of the order in which they appear in the input.\n\nOnce a technician starts working on a prescription, they will finish filling it, even if an in-store prescription is dropped off while they are working. Each prescription requires one pharmacy technician to fill it, and each technician can work on only one prescription at a time. The technicians work until all prescriptions are filled. You should ignore the time it would take for technicians to decide which prescription to fill next, so a technician who finishes a prescription can start working immediately on the next prescription.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput two numbers $o$ and $r$, denoting the average completion time for in-store and remote prescriptions, respectively. A prescription\u2019s completion time is defined as the time difference between when a prescription was dropped off and when it was filled. If there were no in-store or remote prescriptions in the input, output $0$ for $o$ or $r$ instead.

Let s_{i} be the i-th character of string s, and s_{i}..j be the substring of word s, staring at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character (s_{is}_{i} + 1... s_{j}, i \u2264 j).\n\nThen the simple prettiness of s is defined by the formula:$\\operatorname{simple}(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{|s|} \\operatorname{vowel}(s_{i})}{|s|}$\n\nThe prettiness of s equals $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq|s|} \\operatorname{simple}(s_{i . . j})$\n\nFind the prettiness of the given song title.\n\nWe assume that the vowels are I, E, A, O, U, Y.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the title of the song.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the prettiness of the song with the absolute or relative error of at most 10^{ - 6}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nIEAIAIO\n\nOutput\n28.0000000\n\nInput\nBYOB\n\nOutput\n5.8333333\n\nInput\nYISVOWEL\n\nOutput\n17.0500000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample all letters are vowels. The simple prettiness of each substring is 1. The word of length 7 has 28 substrings. So, the prettiness of the song equals to 28.", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLld5akxUtSahbnzK11p9vknaq", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\ndef vowel(c):\n    vowels = \"AEIOUY\"\n    return 1 if c in vowels else 0\n\ndef simple_prettiness(s):\n    total_vowels = sum(vowel(c) for c in s)\n    return total_vowels / len(s)\n\ndef prettiness(s):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i, len(s)):\n            total += simple_prettiness(s[i:j+1])\n    return total\n\ns = input().strip()\nprint(\"{:.7f}\".format(prettiness(s)))\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 512, "completion_tokens": 126, "total_tokens": 638}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4f0b692a78"}, "response": "```python\ndef vowel(c):\n    vowels = \"AEIOUY\"\n    return 1 if c in vowels else 0\n\ndef simple_prettiness(s):\n    total_vowels = sum(vowel(c) for c in s)\n    return total_vowels / len(s)\n\ndef prettiness(s):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i, len(s)):\n            total += simple_prettiness(s[i:j+1])\n    return total\n\ns = input().strip()\nprint(\"{:.7f}\".format(prettiness(s)))\n```", "index": 0}

You might assume that they have a certain amount of contiguous main memory and can store their data wherever is convenient, but unfortunately that is not the case. The probe\u2019s main memory is organised in a number of FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues. In such a queue, data has to be taken out of the queue in the same order as it has been added to it.\n\nA probe has multiple sensors and each sensor is linked to one of the queues. Whenever a sensor finishes recording, it appends the generated data to its queue. A sensor can write data to the queue only if the queue has enough space left to take all the data; if not, the data is lost.\n\nIn order to transfer data from the probe to Earth (in a process called downlinking), the path between the satellite and Earth must not be blocked by anything (e.g.\u00a0a planet like Jupiter) and the antenna must be correctly positioned. During each downlink opportunity, data can be taken from multiple queues and transmitted back to Earth. The total amount of data that can be transmitted during a downlink opportunity depends on the length of the downlink opportunity and distance to Earth. Sensors do not collect data during downlink opportunities, since all electricity available is devoted to the transmitter.\n\nThe most important thing for scientists is not to lose any data recorded by sensors.

The picture below shows how the elevator shows each digit.[Image]\n\nOne day when Malek wanted to go from floor 88 to floor 0 using the elevator he noticed that the counter shows number 89 instead of 88. Then when the elevator started moving the number on the counter changed to 87.

Malek calls an integer x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 99) good if it's possible that the digital counter was supposed to show x but because of some(possibly none) broken sticks it's showing n instead.

However, he has some plan in mind for his path across the booths:  at first, he visits booth number $1$;  if he has enough burles to buy exactly one candy from the current booth, then he buys it immediately;  then he proceeds to the next booth in the clockwise order (regardless of if he bought a candy or not). \n\nPolycarp's money is finite, thus the process will end once he can no longer buy candy at any booth.\n\nCalculate the number of candies Polycarp will buy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $T$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le T \\le 10^{18}$) \u2014 the number of booths at the fair and the initial amount of burles Polycarp has.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the price of the single candy at booth number $i$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the total number of candies Polycarp will buy.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 38\n5 2 5\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n5 21\n2 4 100 2 6\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first example.

The total number of candies bought is $10$.\n\nIn the second example he has $1$ burle left at the end of his path, no candy can be bought with this amount.", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLxYoKHzveShG6isJKO60rHbSE", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nn, T = map(int, input().split())\nprices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_candies = 0\ncurrent_money = T\ncurrent_booth = 0\n\nwhile current_money >= 0:\n    if current_money >= prices[current_booth]:\n        total_candies += 1\n        current_money -= prices[current_booth]\n    else:\n        break\n    \n    current_booth = (current_booth + 1) % n\n\nprint(total_candies)\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 659, "completion_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 767}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35"}, "response": "```python\nn, T = map(int, input().split())\nprices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_candies = 0\ncurrent_money = T\ncurrent_booth = 0\n\nwhile current_money >= 0:\n    if current_money >= prices[current_booth]:\n        total_candies += 1\n        current_money -= prices[current_booth]\n    else:\n        break\n    \n    current_booth = (current_booth + 1) % n\n\nprint(total_candies)\n```", "index": 0}

It offers many different paths to victory but you prefer the blood-and-fire-strategy: build as many soldiers as possible and club your opposition into submission. To be able to build soldiers you need two resources: iron ore and coal. \n\nThe board consists of different cells numbered from $1$ to $n$ which can contain resources. The rules for moving from one cell to another are rather complicated: if you can move from cell A to cell B, it does not always mean that you can also move from B to A. For example, if two cells are connected by a river, then you may be able to move downstream, but not upstream, so long as you didn\u2019t invent a steam engine; however, it still could be possible to reach the upstream cell by using roads and taking a detour over other cells.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you own only one such cell, where all your settlers are located. At every move you are allowed to move an arbitrary number of settlers from a cell to one of its accessible neighbours. By moving your settlers into a cell for the first time, you \u201cclaim\u201d it. Every claimed cell will bind one settler, which has to stay in this cell until the end of the game. However, there is no need to leave a settler in your initial cell because it is where your palace is located and thus the cell stays claimed for all time.\n\nYour goal is to claim at least one cell containing the resource \u201ciron ore\u201d and at least one cell with resource \u201ccoal\u201d in order to be able to build soldiers.

After all, as long as there is some grand logic rule to which of the two dining halls you are being seated in, you (as a mathematician) would be happy!

Your character starts at the X-axis line ($y=0$) and proceeds up the racetrack, which has a boundary at the lines $x=0$ and $x=w$. The finish is at $y=h$, and the game ends when you reach that line. You proceed at a fixed vertical velocity $v$, but you can control your horizontal velocity to be any value between $-v/r$ and $v/r$, where $r$ is a fixed ratio. You may change your horizontal velocity at any time, but your vertical velocity must remain fixed.\n\nThere are gems at specific points on the race track.

{"name": "3012", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nRB is a basketball coach and he has several teams of exceptionally skilled basketball players, who dominate basketball leagues all over the world.\n\nWhy are RB\u2019s players so good? The reason is that each of them has already mastered exactly one ball trick \u2013 either the Triple Spin, or the Power Charge. For convenience, we call the former trick 1 and the latter trick 2. These two tricks are extremely effective in attack.\n\nBesides mastering such powerful trick, each of them also knows how to defend against exactly one ball trick. Therefore, one of their popular training routines is to let two players play against each other, one using a trick and the other trying to defend against it. We call this a move. The one who uses a trick is called an attacker, and the other is called a defender.\n\nRB\u2019s team can perform sequences of moves. To state it more concisely, we use the notation $(\\text {Attacker}, \\text {Defender})$ to represent a move. Suppose the current move is $(\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B})$. A performs the only trick he knows.\n - If A attacks successfully (i.e., B fails to defend), the next move will normally be $(\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\n - However, if it is the third consecutive time A attacks successfully, A will have to take a rest for the next two moves and the next move will be $(\\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D})$ for some other players C and D.\n - If A fails (i.e., B defends successfully), the next move will be $(\\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\n\nNote that in all cases, A, B, C, and D must be pairwise distinct players. In addition, C and D must not be at rest for the next move.\n\n\nToday, RB inspects the team training. He is interested in sequences of moves of length exactly $N$. How many different sequences of moves of length $N$ are there? Two sequences of moves\\[ ((\\mathrm{ATK}_1, \\mathrm{DEF}_1), (\\mathrm{ATK}_2, \\mathrm{DEF}_2), \\ldots , (\\mathrm{ATK}_ N, \\mathrm{DEF}_ N)) \\]\n\nand\\[ ((\\mathrm{ATK}_1^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_1^{'}), (\\mathrm{ATK}_2^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_2^{'}), \\ldots , (\\mathrm{ATK}_ N^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_ N^{'})) \\]\n\nare considered different if and only if for some $i$, $\\mathrm{ATK}_ i \\neq \\mathrm{ATK}_ i^{'}$ or $\\mathrm{DEF}_ i \\neq \\mathrm{DEF}_ i^{'}$.\n\nSince the number may be too large, output it modulo $1000000007$ ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input consists of five non-negative integers, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, $a_{21}$, $a_{22}$, and $N$. $a_{ij}$ denotes the number of players in RB\u2019s team who knows how to perform skill $i$ and how to defend against skill $j$.\n\nFor all test cases, $1 \\leq a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{21} + a_{22} \\leq 5000$, $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{18}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of length-$N$ sequences of moves, modulo $1000000007$.\n\n-----Explanation-----\nFor Sample case 1, let $A$, $B$, $C$ be the players.

{"name": "3258", "prompt": "Generate Python3 code (Markdown):\nEveryone knows that cats love to eat mice. Naturally, when given the opportunity, any cat wants to eat as many mice as possible.\n\nIt just so happens that Cartesian Cat lives on the Cartesian Plane with her home located at $(0, 0)$. Obviously, none of the mice live at this location, they are smarter than that! However, the mice aren\u2019t terribly smart. They live on the plane with Cartesian Cat and at time $t = 0$, stick their heads above the ground, in sight of Cartesian Cat. Each of the mice stays in sight at its location for a specified amount of time before ducking back underground, where Cartesian Cat can\u2019t get it.\n\nCartesian Cat has a plan. At time $t = 0$, she\u2019ll run straight towards a mouse, eat it instantaneously, and then head for another mouse, repeating the sequence until all the mice are eaten. She encounters two problems however: each time she eats a mouse her velocity reduces (due to her increased mass) by a constant multiplicative factor, $m$. That is, if her velocity is $v$ before eating a mouse, then after eating the mouse her velocity is $v\\cdot m$. Also, if she doesn\u2019t reach a mouse before it ducks underground, she won\u2019t be able to eat it. But she can eat a mouse if she reaches it precisely at the time it ducks underground.\n\nSince all cats are efficient by nature, help Cartesian Cat determine what her minimum initial velocity must be if she hopes to eat all of the mice. Assume that she eats the mice in an optimal order.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single positive integer, $n$ (where $1 \\le n \\le 15$), representing the number of mice. Each of the following $n$ lines describes a mouse given as three space-separated integers $x$, $y$, and $s$. This indicates that a mouse is located at $(x, y)$ and will duck underground at $t = s$ seconds. The values of $x$ and $y$ are in the range $[-1000, 1000]$ and $s$ is in the range $[1,10000]$. No two mice are at the same location. The last line of input contains a single floating-point number, $m$, specified to two decimal places, in the range $[0.75, 0.99]$, representing the multiplicative factor by which the cat slows down after eating a single mouse.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum initial velocity (in units per second) necessary for Cartesian Cat to allow her to eat all of the mice, given that she eats them in the optimal order.

Output any reconstruction plan which achieves the smallest distance between the farthest two rooms.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\nSample Output:\n2\n3 4\n4 2", "completion": {"id": "chatcmpl-90cfLrj39bLWpWVOgLLAobkdXRP7l", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709935659, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef dfs(node, parent, graph, distances):\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n        if neighbor != parent:\n            distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + 1\n            dfs(neighbor, node, graph, distances)\n\ndef find_farthest_node(start, graph):\n    distances = defaultdict(int)\n    dfs(start, -1, graph, distances)\n    farthest_node = max(distances, key=distances.get)\n    return farthest_node, distances[farthest_node]\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    farthest_node_1, _ = find_farthest_node(1, graph)\n    farthest_node_2, distance = find_farthest_node(farthest_node_1, graph)\n    \n    print(distance)\n    print(farthest_node_1, farthest_node_2)\n    \n    # Output any reconstruction plan which achieves the smallest distance between the farthest two rooms\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 645}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4f0b692a78"}, "response": "```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef dfs(node, parent, graph, distances):\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n        if neighbor != parent:\n            distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + 1\n            dfs(neighbor, node, graph, distances)\n\ndef find_farthest_node(start, graph):\n    distances = defaultdict(int)\n    dfs(start, -1, graph, distances)\n    farthest_node = max(distances, key=distances.get)\n    return farthest_node, distances[farthest_node]\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    farthest_node_1, _ = find_farthest_node(1, graph)\n    farthest_node_2, distance = find_farthest_node(farthest_node_1, graph)\n    \n    print(distance)\n    print(farthest_node_1, farthest_node_2)\n    \n    # Output any reconstruction plan which achieves the smallest distance between the farthest two rooms\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```", "index": 0}
